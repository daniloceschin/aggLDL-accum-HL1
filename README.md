# Abstract
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a multisystemic and multicellular pathology that is generally associated with high levels of atherogenic lipoproteins in circulation. These lipoproteins tend to be retained and modified, for example aggregated low-density lipoprotein (aggLDL), in the extracellular matrix of different tissues such as the vascular wall and heart. The uptake of aggLDL generates a significant increase in cholesteryl ester (CE) in these tissues. We previously found that accumulation of CE generates alterations in the insulin response in the heart. Although the insulin response is mainly associated with the uptake and metabolism of glucose, other studies have shown that insulin would fulfill other functions in this tissue, such as the regulation of calcium cycle and cardiac contractility. Here, we found that aggLDL induced- lipid accumulation altered gene expression profile involved in processes essential for cardiac functionality, including insulin response and glucose uptake (Insr, Ins1, Pik3ip1, Slc2a4 gene expression), calcium cycle (Cacna1s and Gjc2 gene expression) and calcium-dependent cardiac contractility (Myh3), and cholesterol efflux (Abca1), in HL-1 cardiomyocytes. These observations were recapitulated using an in vivo model of hypercholesterolemic ApoE-KO mice. Altogether, these results may explain the deleterious effect of lipid accumulation in the myocardium, with important implications in lipid-overloaded associated CVD.
